### **Your Role in the Project**

As a **developer/data scientist** working on this project, your responsibilities would include:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Creating synthetic data or integrating with real-world datasets (KYC and transaction data).
   - Cleaning and preparing the data for fraud detection analysis.

2. **Rule-Based Fraud Detection**:
   - Implementing business rules to detect suspicious activities like large transactions, unverified users, and location mismatches.

3. **Machine Learning Model Development**:
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to predict fraud based on various features of the transactions and customer profiles.
   - Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **System Integration and Testing**:
   - Integrating the fraud detection system with real-time transaction processing systems.
   - Testing the system under different scenarios to ensure its effectiveness.

5. **Model Optimization**:
   - Tuning the model to improve performance.
   - Experimenting with more advanced fraud detection algorithms or deep learning methods.

6. **Reporting**:
   - Providing insights and reports on fraud detection trends and patterns for compliance purposes.
